# movies
A website for a few movies and their rankings from Rotten Tomatoes.
In order to see the website, do the following:
1) download WAMP (for Windows machines), LAMP (for Linux machines), MAMP (for Macintosh machines)
2) save all the files from here (my github repository "movies") in one folder and name it anything you want
  (for example, "Movies")
3) put that "Movies" folder in the "htdocs" or "www" directory when you open your WAMP, LAMP, MAMP folder
4) run WAMP/LAMP/MAMP (if the icon is green everything works fine)
5) open a web browser and type "localhost:8888/Movies"
6) 8888 is the port number but for your machine it might be different - it could be 80 or 8080
7) you can look up the ranking for 5 movies in the repository which are: 
- Mortal Kombat
- Princess Bride
- TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)
- TMNT 2 (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2)
- SummerSlam (WWE Pay Per View)
8) to see the ranking for a particular movie you need to type the full URL like this:
--> localhost:8888/Movies/movie.php?film=mortalkombat  OR
--> localhost:8888/Movies/movie.php?film=princessbride  OR
